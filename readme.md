## Gaming Apps Technical Challenge Android

Create a native app that allows users to view search results from the free OMDB API available at http://www.omdbapi.com/

## Requirements

- Call the API for a given search term, which will be provided during the challenge.
- Display the returned results in a clear and concise way, building your UI however you see fit.
- You should create a single table/list view which displays all returned results.
- Validate that your code compiles, runs and works.
- Include inline code comments to ensure that another engineer could pick this project up in future and extend/maintain it easily.

## Expectations

- The app should be developed using the latest version of Kotlin & Android Studio.
- You should not use code generation tools. You will be given a boilerplate project to help you get started.
- Some core dependencies have been provided in a buildSrc module.
- Documentation comments are encouraged.
